# Computer Science Class Projects

#1: ABC is a right triangle as shown below. Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC. A user will input the
lengths of AB and BC and the program will output the measure of ∠𝑀𝐵𝐶 in degrees to the nearest degree.
Sample input: AB = 10, BC = 10, ∠𝑀𝐵𝐶 = 45°

#2: Write a program in which a user enters an amount she has saved up, her current savings rate as a percent
without the percent symbol), and how often her investment compounds each year (as an integer). The program
will tell her how long it will take for her money to double using the compound interest formula.

#3: consists of 2 programs <br>
Program 1: In your very first line type “import math” <br>
  1. User enters how much money she has saved <br>
  2. User enters what she would like to purchase (the amount of the item she would like to purchase) <br>
  3. Program determines if she has enough money saved <br>
  4. If not enough money is saved, the program will determine how long it will take to save the difference in money using a compounded interest formula 𝐴 = 𝑃(1.07)^n𝑡 where A is the amount needed, P is the principle amount, and t is the amount of time in years <br>
Program 2: Write a program in which a user enters a positive angle measured in degrees and the program outputs the
reference angle of that angle.

#4: Days in a month programming project <br>
The user enters a month (1-12) and a year. The program will then tell the user how many days are 
in that month for that given year. Your program needs to determine if that year they type is a leap year.

#5: Write a program (using a while loop) that outputs an 8 session itinerary schedule for a retreat. 
The program asks the user how long each session will be (in minutes) and outputs the days schedule.
The day begins at 8:00AM.
