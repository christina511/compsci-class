# Computer Science Class Projects

#1: ABC is a right triangle as shown below. Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC. A user will input the <br>
lengths of AB and BC and the program will output the measure of ∠𝑀𝐵𝐶 in degrees to the nearest <br>
degree. Sample input: AB = 10, BC = 10, ∠𝑀𝐵𝐶 = 45°

#4: Days in a month programming project <br>
The user enters a month (1-12) and a year. The program will then tell the user how many days are 
in that month for that given year. Your program needs to determine if that year they type is a leap year.

#5: Write a program (using a while loop) that outputs an 8 session itinerary schedule for a retreat. <br>
The program asks the user how long each session will be (in minutes) and outputs the days schedule. <br>
The day begins at 8:00AM.
